# ip2flag
## About

Idea for an API: Given an IP, return an emoji flag.

* Emoji flags here: https://emojipedia.org/flags/
* Maxmind GeoIP API here: https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/

If your OS doesn't support flag emojis, you will see the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code instead (e.g. DE for Germany). RFC 1591, the standard for country-code based TLDs is based on the same standard.
